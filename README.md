I have created a simple calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This calculator can perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The design is minimalist and user-friendly, making it easy to use.

Feel free to explore the code, suggest improvements, or use it as a learning resource for building your own projects.
